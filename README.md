### What is it?

In fact the official colorscheme for tilix on the HP of arcticice doesnt work ive created my own with the the same colors.

### How to install?

Just clone the Repo to your homefolder and move the nord.json inside to the /usr/share/tilix/schemes folder. Then you can set it in the tilix options.

    $ git clone https://github.com/erikschreier/nordic-tilix
    $ cd nordic-tilix
    $ sudo mv nord.json /usr/share/tilix/schemes/
    $ cd .. && rm -rf nordic-tilix
